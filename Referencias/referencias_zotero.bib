	title = {Build your own Alexa with the {ESP}32 and {TensorFlow} Lite},
	url = {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re-dSV_a0tM},
	abstract = {We've been building towards this project in the previous set of videos. And we're now ready to build our very own {DIY} Alexa!

All the code for this project is on {GitHub} - https://github.com/atomic14/diy-alexa

What are we building - 1:15
Wake Word Detection - 2:27
Command Recognition - 11:47
Digging into the code - 16:30
What's life all about Marvin? - 21:52

To detect the wake words we stream audio from either an I2S microphone or from the {ADC}. The wake word detector looks at a 1-second window of audio. The spectrogram of the audio is calculated and fed into a {TensorFlow} Lite model.

Once we detect the wake word we stream the audio up to wit.ai to recognise the user's intent.

It works surprisingly well for such a small model, there are improvements that could be made with more training data.

I'll leave the access token for wit.ai live for as long as I can, but at some point, you will need to generate your own wit.ai application.

Let me know how you get on in the comments!

We create a very simple model in {TensorFlow}, train it up, and then export it for use in {TensorFlow} Lite. We then get this model working in a simple Platform.io project and run it on the {ESP}32.

	url = {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g7l5bm7fZ8},
	abstract = {We're back looking at some more options for getting audio data into the {ESP}32!

In the previous video, we looked at a couple of microphone boards (the {MAX}9814 and the {MAX}4466) using the {ESP}32's built-in analogue to digital converter and I2S peripheral to read the audio data.: https://youtu.be/{pPh}3\_ciEmzs

It's worth recapping that video as there's some interesting stuff around sampling rates, {DMA} transfer and {ADC} calibration.

If you like {ESP}32 audio videos - I've got a complete set on this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...

In this video, we're going to be looking at a couple of boards with {MEMS} (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) microphones.

The two boards we're looking at are the {SPH}0645 and the {INMP}441.

What's really interesting with these boards is that they integrate the audio amplifier, {ADC} and the I2S interface. So the output from the boards can be fed directly into the {ESP}32 without using the {ADC}.

Once again we're taking advantage of I2S and {DMA} transfers to get the data into the {ESP}32.

The code I used is all in the {GitHub} repo here: https://github.com/atomic14/esp32\_audio

In the next video, we'll look at getting audio out of the {ESP}32, another small step to finishing my next project.

Thanks for watching, and don't forget to subscribe!
